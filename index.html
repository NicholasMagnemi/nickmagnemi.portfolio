                    This final project demonstrates the skills I learned in this web design class. I learned how to create HTML that includes CSS (cascading style sheets). These skills allowed me to memorialize a wonderful family vacation with amazing photos and commentary. I enjoyed making this website and found the skills I learned valuable.

                    This class taught programming concepts, including decisions, loops, and encapsulation using the Scribbler 3 (S3) Robot's graphical programming environment. This was a great class, and it provided satisfaction when the robot successfully carried out the instructions I coded.

                    My final project for this class was to enhance the offerings of a mini golf course by installing a virtual reality center. I was interested in this topic as I am a fan of gaming. I had to research options and offerings and cost them out. I got my feet wet managing a project as well as exposure to different types of management methodologies.

                <p class="box-content">
                    In this class, we explored how to utilize object-oriented code. The capstone project was to create a program that converted numeric values into their equivalent words. Initially, I thought this would be difficult, but as we learned during the semester, I realized this project would not be as challenging as I feared. This was great news and allowed me to realize that I could learn programming languages.

                    This class was taken as an independent study to learn about data structures and algorithms in programming. The final project is to create a data structure of my choice in C++. I chose to create a binary search tree. I found this class very intellectually stimulating; I enjoyed the individual attention of meeting with the professor one-on-one and working at my pace.

                    This was a very enlightening course for me; I never really focused on pop culture. My final project was an analysis of daytime TV talk shows. I focused on the genre that includes "Jerry Springer" and "Dr. Phil." I analyzed the effect these types of shows have on the masses and the niche they fill for society. It is fascinating, and those shows are shocking and sometimes offensive and yet highly popular. This class broadened my horizons.

                    This was a great class; many of the skills I learned (to help me mentor other PAL students) apply in many different settings and situations. Interacting with peers in and outside of class, I can see that I will also use these skills in the workplace. The final project was a presentation about what we can learn from those who are in the minority. In my project, I focused on what we can learn from people with learning disabilities.

                    My final project was about Herbert Lubalin, a famous American graphic designer known as the 'Father of Conceptual Typography.' Had I not taken this class, I would have remained completely unaware of this fantastic human. It was so interesting to learn about him. He is the one who made the NBC Peacock logo among other well known logos with meaning.

                    I did not study abroad, but this class was informative and made me wish I could have had this opportunity. It would have been a wonderful experience. For my final project presentation was on a place I would like to study abroad in. I selected Ireland. I truly enjoyed learning about the country and its history. This county is also on my travel bucket list.
